/*:
 ### Benefits of POP
 
 * **Protocol Definition**
    * We define a protocol to outline the methods that the delegate must implement.
 
 * **Weak Delegate Property**
    * We use a weak reference for the delegate property to avoid *retain cycles*, ensuring proper *memory management*.
 
 * **Protocol Conformance**
    * The User class conforms to the `PostDriver.Delegate` protocol and provides concrete implementations for the protocol's methods.
 
 * **Loose Coupling**
    * The PostDriver class does not need to know about the specifics of the User class, promoting loose coupling and better separation of concerns.
